# Happy Thoughts

The app shows 20 messages from a API that I created in another project where the
user can submit messages and like both their own and others messages for as long
as they are shown on the site.

## The problem

I started with the functions and moved on to design after all of the
functionality was in place. Would have wanted to add a loader and some animation
to the app if I had more time.
